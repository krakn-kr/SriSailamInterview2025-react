What are the uses of all the Hooks in React?

1. useState: Used for adding state to functional components

2. useEffect: Enables performing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching.

3. useContext: Allows functional components to consume values from a React context.


4. useReducer: Provides an alternative to useState when the state logic is more complex.

5. useCallback: Memoizes a callback function to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components.
 
6. useMemo: Memoizes the result of a function to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary recalculations. 
 
7. useRef: Creates a mutable object that persists across renders (used for interacting with DOM
elements). 

8. useLayoutEffect: Similar to useEffect but fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.
